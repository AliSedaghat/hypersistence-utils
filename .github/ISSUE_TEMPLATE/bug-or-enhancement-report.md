**No free-of-charge support**

Before you file an issue, note that there is **no free-of-charge support**. This project is Free, as in Libre, not Gratis.

As explained in the [README](https://github.com/vladmihalcea/hypersistence-utils#bug-fixes-and-enhancements) file, only if you purchase a Paid support plan, we will investigate and assist you with a problem.

Alternatively, you can file the issue, investigate the solution, and submit a Pull Request with a fix. However, due to lack of time, I can only review the submitted Pull Requests from time to time, so you may need to wait several months until the Pull Request is reviewed and integrated.
